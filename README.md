Mental health literacy is the gateway for mental health interventions in India. There is a lack of awareness which can lead to overlooking, misjudging or dismissing the signs that someone needs help.


Indians represent (1/5)th of the world's population,who share a common history,a common cultural background and a population which is still striving-hard to cut off the tag of poverty, overcoming the British barbarism which lasted 200 years and sharing a  history of being suppressed culturally and emotionally.


When it comes to mental health awareness amongst Indians, terms like- Therapy,OCD, Anxiety, Depression,Rehab from Substance Abuse ; a lot of "Liberal Indians" don't hesitate to impose the "American Self-Help" model on the Indian society and then expect the Indians to "get aware" and be "progressive" with no regard to our cultural backgrounds.

An average Middle-Class Indian Needs Someone From his/her Own Community to vent out their emotions to,you can't expect them to be "progressive" and "open minded" and talk freely about their emotions to "anyone" when they have so many other daily issues to pay heed to!


In 2017, an estimation of the burden of mental health conditions for the states across India revealed that as many as 197.3 million people required care for mental health conditions. This included around 45.7 million people with depressive disorders and 44.9 million people with anxiety disorders. The situation has been exacerbated due to the Covid-19 pandemic, making it a serious concern world over.

The staggering figures, however, are void of millions of others directly, or indirectly impacted by the challenge and those who face deep rooted stigma, many times rendering them unable to seek help.
